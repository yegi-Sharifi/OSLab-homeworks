\section{TEXT}

Cognitive distortions are simply ways that our mind convinces us of something that isn't really true.\\ These inaccurate thoughts are usually used to reinforce negative thinking or emotions — telling ourselves things that sound rational and accurate, but really only serve to keep us feeling bad about ourselves\\\newline
\textbf{What causes cognitive distortions?}\\ If you suffer from anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, or perfectionism, your thinking can skew your perceptions. Cognitive distortions reflect flawed thinking, often stemming from insecurity and low-self-esteem. Negative filters distort reality and can generate stressful emotions.\\\newline
